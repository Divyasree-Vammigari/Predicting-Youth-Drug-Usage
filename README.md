In this project, we aimed to analyze and predict marijuana consumption by youth using the 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This survey data consists of responses from all the 
people above age 12 in the United States. This data have more than 300 columns and vast 
number of respondents. This study is mostly focused on impact of the usage of marijuana on 
the youth. We can find answers for how much the marijuana is used, how many days in the last 
year marijuana used by the youth , how many days of school was missed due to marijuana 
usage based on the factors such as situations in school as fight, friends impact on usage of 
marijuana, parents strictness , grades and religious beliefs. In order to analyze all these factors 
, decision tree and ensembles where used to conclude to the potential factors in order to prevent 
and reduce the youth from usage of marijuana. 

We have explored three types of problems one being binary 
classification for Marijuana usage, multi-class classification for number days marijuana used 
in past year and regression for number of days school missed with multiple models such as 
random forest, bagging, boosting. Based on the importance variables and plots we have 
understood  the usage of marijuana by youth, next we have understood how the usage of 
marijuana in the last year  impacted by the demographic and substance factors. Additionally , 
analysed how usage marijuana effected the youth from missing the school.
